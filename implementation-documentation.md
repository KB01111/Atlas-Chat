## Implementation Details

### OpenAI Agent SDK Integration

#### SDK Executor (`backend/app/core/executors/sdk_executor.py`)

The SDK Executor is responsible for initializing the OpenAI Agent SDK, registering tools, and executing agents. It provides a clean interface for interacting with the OpenAI Agent SDK.

```python
class OpenAIAgentSDKExecutor:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "gpt-4o"):
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        self.model = model
        self.tools = {}
        self.tool_definitions = []

        # Initialize the agent
        self.agent = self.client.beta.agents.create(
            name="Atlas-Chat Agent",
            description="A versatile agent for Atlas-Chat that can perform various tasks",
            model=self.model,
            tools=self.tool_definitions
        )

    def register_tool(self, func: Callable):
        # Register a function as a tool
        # ...

    async def execute_agent(self, message: str, callback: Callable[[str], None]):
        # Execute the agent with the given message
        # ...
```

### E2B Desktop Integration

#### E2B Session (`backend/app/core/services/e2b/session.py`)

The E2B Session provides a clean interface for interacting with the E2B desktop environment. It handles session initialization, file operations, and process execution.

```python
class E2BSession:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.session = e2b.Session(api_key=api_key)
        self.filesystem = self.session.filesystem
        self.process = self.session.process

    async def create_file(self, path: str, content: str):
        # Create a file in the E2B environment
        # ...

    async def read_file(self, path: str) -> str:
        # Read a file from the E2B environment
        # ...

    async def list_directory(self, path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # List a directory in the E2B environment
        # ...

    async def execute_command(self, cmd: List[str]) -> ProcessResult:
        # Execute a command in the E2B environment
        # ...
```

#### Artifact Manager (`backend/app/core/services/e2b/artifacts.py`)

The Artifact Manager handles the creation, storage, and retrieval of artifacts generated during agent execution.

```python
class ArtifactManager:
    def __init__(self, e2b_session: E2BSession):
        self.e2b_session = e2b_session
        self.artifacts: Dict[str, Artifact] = {}
        self.artifact_dir = "/artifacts"

    async def initialize(self):
        # Initialize the artifact manager
        # ...

    async def create_artifact(self, content: Union[str, bytes], name: str, content_type: str, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Artifact:
        # Create a new artifact
        # ...

    async def get_artifact(self, artifact_id: str) -> Optional[Artifact]:
        # Get an artifact by ID
        # ...

    async def scan_for_artifacts(self) -> List[Artifact]:
        # Scan for new artifacts in the artifact directory
        # ...
```

### Agent Team Interactions

#### Agent Delegation Service (`backend/app/core/services/e2b/delegation.py`)

The Agent Delegation Service manages agent teams, task delegation, and team communication.

```python
class AgentDelegationService:
    def __init__(self, e2b_session: E2BSession):
        self.e2b_session = e2b_session
        self.artifact_manager = ArtifactManager(e2b_session)
        self.teams: Dict[str, AgentTeam] = {}
        self.task_callbacks: Dict[str, List[Callable[[AgentTask], Awaitable[None]]]] = {}

    async def initialize(self):
        # Initialize the agent delegation service
        # ...

    def create_team(self, name: str, supervisor_name: str, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> AgentTeam:
        # Create a new team with a supervisor
        # ...

    def add_agent_to_team(self, team_id: str, name: str, role: AgentRole, capabilities: List[str], metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[Agent]:
        # Add an agent to a team
        # ...

    def create_coding_agent(self, team_id: str, name: str, languages: List[str], metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[Agent]:
        # Create a coding agent and add it to a team
        # ...

    async def delegate_coding_task(self, team_id: str, title: str, description: str, language: str, code: Optional[str] = None, priority: str = "medium", metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[AgentTask]:
        # Delegate a coding task to an appropriate agent in the team
        # ...

    async def execute_coding_task(self, team_id: str, task_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Execute a coding task using the E2B code interpreter
        # ...

    async def update_task_progress(self, team_id: str, task_id: str, progress: int, status: Optional[str] = None, comment: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
        # Update the progress of a task
        # ...

    async def send_team_message(self, team_id: str, content: str, sender_id: str, message_type: str = "text") -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # Send a message to a team chat
        # ...
```

### UI Enhancements

#### Artifact Display (`frontend/client/src/components/Artifacts/ArtifactDisplay.jsx`)

The Artifact Display component has been enhanced to provide a better user experience for viewing and interacting with artifacts.

```jsx
const ArtifactDisplay = ({
  artifact,
  onClose,
  onDownload,
  onShare,
  showMetadata = false,
}) => {
  // Component state
  const [isFullscreen, setIsFullscreen] = useState(false);
  const [language, setLanguage] = useState("text");
  const [content, setContent] = useState("");
  const [isImage, setIsImage] = useState(false);
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState("");
  const [showDetails, setShowDetails] = useState(false);
  const [isHovering, setIsHovering] = useState(false);

  // Component logic
  // ...

  // Render component
  return (
    <div
      className={`artifact-display ${isFullscreen ? "fullscreen" : ""} ${isHovering ? "hover" : ""}`}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovering(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovering(false)}
    >
      {/* Component UI */}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Docker Compose configuration has been updated to ensure reliable production deployment.

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been implemented to ensure the reliability of the implemented features. The tests cover:

- **SDK Executor**: Tests for initialization, tool registration, and agent execution.
- **E2B Session**: Tests for session initialization, file operations, and process execution.
- **Artifact Manager**: Tests for artifact creation, retrieval, and scanning.
- **Agent Delegation**: Tests for team creation, agent addition, task delegation, and task execution.

## Conclusion

The implemented changes have significantly improved the Atlas-Chat application, making it ready for production deployment. The application now provides advanced computer use capabilities through the OpenAI Agent SDK, enhanced E2B desktop integration, a modern UI matching the Manus.im style, reliable Docker configuration for production deployment, and robust agent team interactions for collaborative work.

## Next Steps

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for production deployment, there are still some areas that could be further improved:

1. **API Endpoints**: Update API endpoints for agent interactions to provide a cleaner interface for frontend components.
2. **Security Measures**: Enhance security measures for agent operations to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and pagination for better performance with large datasets.
4. **Documentation**: Create more detailed API documentation and user guides for the new features.
5. **Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests, especially for edge cases and error conditions.
