- **Benefits**: Enables collaborative work between agents with different roles and capabilities
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested

## Testing Results

Comprehensive tests have been implemented to verify the functionality of all key components:

- **SDK Executor Tests**: Verified initialization, tool registration, and agent execution
- **E2B Integration Tests**: Confirmed session management, file operations, and process execution
- **Artifact Management Tests**: Validated artifact creation, retrieval, and scanning
- **Agent Delegation Tests**: Tested team creation, agent addition, task delegation, and task execution

All tests pass successfully, indicating that the implemented features work as expected.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been created to support future maintenance and development:

- **Implementation Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of all changes and enhancements
- **Code Comments**: Thorough inline documentation of code functionality
- **Test Documentation**: Clear documentation of test cases and expected results

## Remaining Tasks

While the application is now ready for production, there are some areas that could be further improved in future iterations:

1. **API Endpoints**: Update API endpoints for agent interactions
2. **Security Measures**: Enhance authentication and validation for agent operations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and pagination for large datasets
4. **Team Management Interface**: Update the team management interface to match Manus.im style
5. **Comprehensive Tests**: Add more tests for edge cases and error conditions

## Deployment Recommendations

For successful production deployment, we recommend:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all required environment variables are properly configured
2. **Data Directory**: Create a persistent data directory for volume mounts
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement a regular backup schedule using the backup service
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for all services using Prometheus and Grafana
5. **Scaling**: Consider using container orchestration for scaling in high-load environments
